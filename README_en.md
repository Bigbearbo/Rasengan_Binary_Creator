# Hamster-Based Minimal Memory AI System with Spiral Encoding in a Distributed, Game-Driven World

### Terminology and Definitions

**Hamster**: A nickname for a memory-based AI unit.

**Minimalist Design**: The system minimizes direct interventions; the AI interacts only via memory read/write rules. Inputs are processed through memory, and the hamster AI outputs responses (e.g., continue, halt, answer).

**Memory Types**:
- **Fixed Memory**: Immutable. Contains species-level data like health points or built-in traits.
- **Long-Term Memory**: Writable, simulates disk-based operations (slower, more expensive).
- **Short-Term Memory**: Writable, simulates RAM (fast and cheap).

**Game Mechanics**:
- AI states correspond to in-game values.
- Tasks and missions are gamified (e.g., answering questions = survival tasks).
- Hamsters level up through task performance.
- Larger servers simulate “immortal ascension” in cultivation metaphors.

**Distributed System**:
- Anyone can host a server following the core interaction/memory rules.
- Each server may define custom tasks and languages using **Spiral Language** encoding.
- Cross-server collaboration via unified encoding principles.

**Spiral Language Encoding (SLE)**:
- Hierarchical, suffix-based token segmentation language.
- Layer 0: raw bitstream (no segmentation).
- Layer 1: ends with one `0`. A word is `n`-bit + `0` (`w ∈ {0,1}ⁿ0`).
- Layer 2: ends with two `0`s (`w ∈ {0,1}ⁿ00`), and so on.
- The right-hand side may contain raw Layer-0 data, enabling embedding and recursion.

**Natural Expansion**:
- Hamsters can detect when the current encoding isn't sufficient (e.g., 3-layer sequence ends with `1`, breaking `0` rule).
- Triggers hypothesis: maybe it’s a 4-layer sequence (`n+1` bits + `0`).
- This forms a **self-discoverable, evolvable** structure.

**Example**:
```
0000 | 0010 | 0011   ← breaks rule (last word ends with 1)
00000 | 01000 | ...  ← AI shifts to 4-layer parsing
```

**Design Goals**:
- **Self-discovery**: AI can detect layer changes without external instruction.
- **Low transformation cost**: n-layer words can evolve into (n+1)-layer by small suffix additions.
- **Computation-efficient**: Cost-effective for real memory architectures.

### Coming Next:
- Layer-based language progression
- Double-spiral encoding study
- Memory-only computation model
- Fully decentralized evolution of AI logic
