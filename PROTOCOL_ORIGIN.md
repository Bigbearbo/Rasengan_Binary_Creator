### Definition Scope

The following components were **first proposed and versioned** in this repository:

- **Spiral Language Encoding (SLE)**  
  A binary token system using end-zero segmentation for hierarchical language structuring.  
  Syntax: `w ∈ {0,1}ⁿ · 0ᵏ`, where `k` indicates depth level.

- **Minimalist AI Memory Architecture**  
  Simulated agent memory is categorized into:
  - Fixed Memory (genetic presets, immutable states)
  - Long-Term Memory (experience, compressed logs)
  - Short-Term Memory (real-time reasoning)

- **Energy-Based Evolutionary Selection**  
  Every agent action consumes resources. Evolution favors high-efficiency behavior through `CONTINUE`, `EMIT`, and `STOP` logic.

- **Distributed Co-evolution System**  
  Multiple servers simulate agent-language-task co-adaptation under localized spiral protocol variants.

- **Natural Language Emergence via Task Pressure**  
  Communication structures arise from collaborative task solving under gamified survival incentives.
